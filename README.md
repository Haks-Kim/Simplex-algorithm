# Simplex algorithm
* Implementation of 'two-phase revised simplex method' in **'Introduction to linear optimization' (Bertsimas, Dimitris, and John N. Tsitsiklis)** which was done in August, 2021 as a part of summer LP study. 


### Description
* main.py: choose the problem instance and run the simplex algorithm
* Simplex.py: 'two-phase revised simplex method' in chapter 3 of the above mentioned book
* Problem_set.pu: generation of LP problem instances including examples in the book


### Example
